# Dotfizzles

**Dotfizzles in the hizzay dirz! Fo shizzle.**

## What’s this?

My personal dot file setup bash stuffs; use at your own risk. <img width="20" height="20" align="absmiddle" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/no_mouth.png" alt=":no_mouth:" title=":no_mouth:" class="emoji">

## Installation

From the command line, run:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://git.io/v2A8D)
```

1. Reload:

 ```bash
 $ source ~/.bash_profile && reload
 ```
 
1. Optional, but I’d suggest restarting your computer (this will get `defaults write ...` working).

## Notes

1. Install Brew’s bash completion: `$ brew install bash-completion`.
1. The `.gitconfig` contains a name and e-mail that you’ll want to change.
1. Check out the [WIKI](../../wiki) for more info.
